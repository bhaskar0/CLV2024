## Customer Lifetime Value analysis 2024

The lifetime value of a customer, or customer lifetime value (CLV), represents the total amount of money a customer is expected to spend in the business, or on the products, during their lifetime. This is an important figure to know because it helps to make decisions about how much money to invest in acquiring new customers and retaining existing ones.

Customer lifetime time value (CLTV) helps to answer below important questions about sales:

1) How to recognize the most profitable customers?
2) How to utilize the products and make money out of that?
3) How to segment profitable customers?

#Below formula has been used to calculate the CLTV

CLTV = ((Average Order Value x Purchase Frequency)/Churn Rate) x Profit margin.
Purchase Frequency = Total transactions / Total customers
Repeat Rate = (Number of customers who made more than 1 transaction)/Total number of customers
Churn Rate = 1 - Repeat Rate
Profit Margin = 5% of Money Spent
